 pru_victors_from_7yw_desc:0 "The Seven Years War lasted from 1756 to 1763, and was probably the biggest war with more open fronts worldwide until now. It all started as a dispute between Austria and Prussia, but it ended being a giant war between most of the great powers of the world. \n Despite being alone in continental Europe fighting against Austria, France and Russia for years and suffering nearly half a millon of casualties, the Prussian army proved itself the most disciplined and hardened of the world under the leadership of Frederick the Great. \n The times of the Soldier King are gone, but Prussia still remains as a prestigious military power in Central Europe and looks forward to unify the German people."
