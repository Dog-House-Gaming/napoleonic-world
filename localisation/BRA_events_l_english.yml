 brazil.1.d:0 "Found in the limits of the Amazonas rainforest, this man was wearing strange clothes and shouting in a rare accent. At first we thought that he was asking where was him, but then w understood he was asking WHEN.\n He was taken to the local authorities and he guided them to a machine he had left in the jungle. They thought he was mad, but then they were left open-mouthed when they saw the unbelievable technology that he was trying to explain.\nHe was brought to the capital and told us that he is the leader from Brazil in the future and has come to prevent a tragedy that will destroy the reputation of the country in the future."
